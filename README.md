# 🔷 Multilingual Sentiment Analysis using Transformer Models
🚀 Project Title: Bias-Free Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Using DistilBERT-based Transformer

# 🌐 Overview:
In the pursuit of fairness and global understanding, I built a powerful multilingual sentiment analysis model to eliminate bias and capture emotional tones across languages. My previous model displayed skewed results, especially when handling diverse cultural expressions. To overcome this, I leveraged a pretrained transformer model from Hugging Face, specifically:

🔍 Model: tabularisai/multilingual-sentiment-analysis
🧠 Base: distilbert/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased
🗣️ Supported Languages: 20+ including English, Hindi, Bengali, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and more
🎯 Task: Text Classification (5-Class Sentiment: Very Negative → Very Positive)

# ✅ Why This Model?
Unlike traditional models, this transformer is fine-tuned on synthetic multilingual data, generated by advanced LLMs, allowing it to generalize across languages and cultural sentiments. It’s optimized for use cases like:

Social media emotion detection

Global brand monitoring

Multilingual customer review analysis

International feedback mining

# 🛠️ Model Performance:

Train Accuracy (Off-By-One Tolerance): ~93%

Fine-Tuned for 3.5 epochs

Bias Mitigated through synthetic data and balanced class distribution

Deployed and tested on real-world multilingual sentiment inputs

💡 This project underscores the power of transformers in solving bias, creating fair NLP systems that understand the emotional pulse of the world—no matter the language.

📊 Let’s build AI that listens globally, not just locally.
